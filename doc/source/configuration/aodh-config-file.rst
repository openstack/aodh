Aodh Sample Configuration File
==============================

Configure Aodh by editing /etc/aodh/aodh.conf.

No config file is provided with the source code, it will be created during
the installation. In case where no configuration file was installed, one
can be easily created by running::

    aodh-config-generator


.. only:: html

   The following is a sample Aodh configuration for adaptation and use.
   It is auto-generated from Aodh when this documentation is built, and
   can also be viewed in `file form <../_static/aodh.conf.sample>`_.

   .. literalinclude:: ../_static/aodh.conf.sample
