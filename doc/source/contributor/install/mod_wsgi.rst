==================================
Installing the API behind mod_wsgi
==================================

Aodh comes with a WSGI application file named `aodh/api/app.wsgi` for
configuring the API service to run behind Apache with ``mod_wsgi``. This file
is installed with the rest of the Aodh application code, and should not need to
be modified.

You can then configure Apache with something like this::

    Listen 8042

    <VirtualHost *:8042>
        WSGIDaemonProcess aodh-api processes=2 threads=10 user=SOMEUSER display-name=%{GROUP}
        WSGIProcessGroup aodh-api
        WSGIScriptAlias / /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/aodh/api/app
        WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
        ErrorLogFormat "%{cu}t %M"
        ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/aodh_error.log
        CustomLog /var/log/httpd/aodh_access.log combined
    </VirtualHost>

    WSGISocketPrefix /var/run/httpd


Modify the ``WSGIDaemonProcess`` directive to set the ``user`` and ``group``
values to an appropriate user on your server. In many installations ``aodh``
will be correct.
