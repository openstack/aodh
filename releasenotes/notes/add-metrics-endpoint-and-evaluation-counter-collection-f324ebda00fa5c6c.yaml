    Added collection of alarm evaluation counters. These show the number of
    times alarms were evaluated as ``alarm``, ``ok`` and ``insufficient data``
    per alarm. These counters are presented by the /v2/metrics API endpoint.
    This feature can be enabled or disabled with
    the ``[DEFAULT].enable_evaluation_results_metrics`` configuration option.
    It's disabled by default.
